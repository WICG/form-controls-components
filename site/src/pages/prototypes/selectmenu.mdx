# How to use the &lt;selectmenu&gt; component

Based on the [select](/components/select) proposal, the implementation of a new `<selectmenu>` control has started in [Chromium](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5737365999976448).
This control is available in Chromium-based browsers by enabling the **Experimental Web Platform features** experiment in about:flags.

## Help test the control

`<selectmenu>` is not ready for production use yet, but we value your feedback if you want to spend some time testing it.

By being an early tester, you can actively help us make the control better for everyone. Read the documentation below to learn how to use the control.

If you encouter bugs or limitations with the design of the control, please send your feedback by [creating issues on the open-ui GitHub repository](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/new?title=[select]%20&labels=select).
