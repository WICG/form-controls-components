## Notes

While not called out explicitly, sliders usually have a min/max value.

Sliders with a filled in slide indicates whether or not the values include the preceding value. Sliders without a filled in slide indicate an individual point is selected.

Snapping behavior is supported by some sliders. That's where there are only a select few steps and the slider jumps to those points rather than smoothly going between them.

Most sliders support a "controlled" state where a value can be entered elsewhere and the slider will move the appropriate position that accompanies the value
