An accordion is a sequence of
[disclosure](/components/disclosure.research)
widgets in a row.

Some accordions are exclusive,
which means that at any moment in time,
only zero or one of the disclosure widgets can be open.
In an exclusive accordion, opening one of the items
closes any existing open item.

Some exclusive accordions are even more specific
and at any moment in time
exactly one disclosure widget is open.
For lack of a better term, I'll call these exact-exclusive.

Of the design systems below, the following are never exclusive:
* Carbon Design System
* KoliBri
* Lightning Design System,
* Lion

The following are always exclusive:
* Semantic UI
* Material UI

The following can be exclusive or not exclusive:
* Bootstrap
* Stardust UI
* Tailwind Elements

The following can be either not exclusive or exact-exclusive:
* FAST
