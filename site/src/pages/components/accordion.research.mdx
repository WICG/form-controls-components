An accordion is a sequence of
[disclosure](/components/disclosure.research)
widgets in a row.

Some accordions are exclusive,
which means that at any moment in time,
only zero or one of the disclosure widgets can be open.
In an exclusive accordion, opening one of the items
closes any existing open item.

Some exclusive accordions are even more specific
and at any moment in time
exactly one disclosure widget is open.
For lack of a better term, I'll call these exact-exclusive.

Of the design systems below, the following are never exclusive:
* Carbon Design System
* KoliBri
* Lightning Design System,
* Lion

The following defaults to not exclusive, but exclusivity behavior of any
sort can be implemented in the code using the widget:
* Material UI

The following can be exclusive or not exclusive:
* Bootstrap (exclusive when `data-bs-parent` is used)
* Stardust UI (defaults to not exclusive)
* Tailwind Elements (exclusive when `data-te-parent` is used)

The following can be exclusive, not exclusive, or exact-exclusive:
* Semantic UI (defaults to exclusive, not exclusive with `exclusive=false`, exact-exclusive with `collapsible=false`)

The following can be either not exclusive or exact-exclusive:
* FAST (defaults to not exclusive)
