# Interest Invokers

## Pitch in Code

```html
<button interesttarget="my-tooltip">Hover/Focus to show the tooltip</button>

<span popover=hint id="my-toolip">This is the tooltip</span>
```

## Introduction

Following [invokers](../invokers.explainer), adding an `interesttarget` and `interestaction`
attributes to interactive elements: starting with `<button>`, `<input
type="button">`/`<input type="reset">`/`<input type="submit">`, and `<a>` (perhaps
expanding to `<area>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<summary>` or maybe more, see
[#14](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/908)). This would allow
disclosure of high fidelity tooltips in a more accessible and declarative way.
Elements with `interesttarget` will - when hovered, or focussed (or an equivalent
user-agent determined action) - dispatch an `InterestEvent` on the element
referenced by `interesttarget`, with some default behaviours.

### Terms

- Interest/Shows Interest: The action of _Interest_ refers to the user "landing"
  on an element without invoking it, using a Human Input Device (HID). See below
  for how various HIDs can show interest.
- Loses Interest/Lost Interest: The action of _Loses Interest_ refers to the user
  "moving away" from an element, or its _interestee_, using a HID; in other words
  interest must be on a different element that is neither. Elements can only
  _Lose Interest_ if they are in the state of Showing Interest. See below for
  how various HIDs can lose interest.
- Interestee: An element which is referenced to by an Interest element, via the
  `interesttarget` attribute.


### HIDs and interest

Interest is shown and lost based on a user gesture, which will be dependent on
the users Human Input Device (HID). A keyboard will use focus to determine
interest equivalent to the `focusin`/`focusout` events available today. A
pointer device, such as a mouse, will use the `pointerenter`/`pointerleave`.

"Interest" is an intentional abstraction from traditional keyboard and pointer
events to allow other HIDs to map an appropriate (privacy preserving) user
gesture, without emulating or otherwise conflicting with keyboard or pointer
events. For example a user agent with a touch screen HID _might_ map showing
interest to a menu item in the devices long-press context-menu, while a device
with hand tracking (such as mixed reality headsets) might offer an explicit hand
gesture.

While the proposal aims to encompass alternate HIDs and decvices, the specifics
precisely how these HIDs will show Interest is not part of the initial proposal,
and is an area of active discussion. It also stands to reason that
to-be-invented devices may introduce new and novel concepts of showing/losing
interest.

## Proposed Plan

In the style of `invoketarget`, this document proposes we add `interesttarget` and `interestaction`
as available attributes to `<button>`, `<a>`, and `<input>` elements.

```webidl
interface mixin InterestInvokerElement {
  [CEReactions] attribute Element? interestTargetElement;
  [CEReactions] attribute DOMString interestAction;
};
HTMLButtonElement includes InterestInvokerElement
HTMLInputElement includes InterestInvokerElement
HTMLAnchorElement includes InterestInvokerElement
```

The `interesttarget` value should be an IDREF pointing to an element within the
document. `.interestTargetElement` also exists on the element to imperatively
assign a node to be the invoker target, allowing for cross-root invokers (in
some cases, see [attr-asociated element
steps](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#attr-associated-element)
for more).

The `interestaction` (and the `interestAction` reflected property) is a freeform hint
to the interestee. InterestAction can be a "built-in" action or a "custom" action.
If `interestaction` is a false value (`''``, `null`, etc), then it will default to
an `auto` state.

Built-in interactive elements have built-in behaviours (detailed below) which
are determined by the `interestaction`. The built-in names _must not_ contain a
`-`. An `interestaction` without a dash that is not a built-in is considered
invalid, and will not dispatch an InterestEvent.

Valid interestactions (that is: custom interestaction or a valid built-in) will
dispatch InterestEvent, allowing custom code to take control of interest invocations (for
example calling `.preventDefault()` or executing custom side-effects).

Elements with `interesttarget` set will dispatch an `InterestEvent` on the
_Interestee_ (the element referenced by `interesttarget`) when the element
_Shows Interest_ or _Loses Interest_. When the element _Shows Interest_ the
event type will be `'interest'`. If the element has _Shown Interest_, and
interest moves away from both the _Interest Element_ and the _Interestee_, then
the element _Loses Interest_ and an `InterestEvent` with the type of
`'loseinterest'` will be dispatched on the _Interestee_. The event also contains
a `invoker` property that will reference the _Interest_ element.
`InterestEvent` objects are always non-bubbling, composed, cancellable events.

```webidl
[Exposed=Window]
interface InterestEvent : Event {
  constructor(DOMString type, InterestEventInit interestEventInit);
  readonly attribute Element invoker;
  readonly attribute DOMString type = "interest";
  readonly attribute DOMString action;
};
dictionary InterestEventInit : EventInit {
  DOMString action = "";
  Element invoker;
};
```

Both `interesttarget` and `invoketarget` can exist on the same element at the
same time, and both should be respected.

If a `<button>` is a form participant, or has `type=submit`, then `invoketarget`
_must_ be ignored. `interesttarget` is still valid in these scenarios.

If an `<input>` is a form participant, or has a `type` other than `reset` or
`button`, then `invoketarget` and `interesttarget` _must_ be ignored. `interesttarget`
additionally works with `type` of `submit`.

### Example Code

#### Popovers

An `interesttarget` allows for tooltips using `popover`:

```html
<button interesttarget="my-popover">Open Popover</button>

<div id="my-popover" popover="hint">Hello world</div>
```

#### Custom behaviour

Elements with _Interest_ will dispatch events on the _Interestee_ element,
allowing for custom JavaScript to be triggered without having to wire up manual
event handlers to the Interest elements.

```html
<button interesttarget="my-custom" interestaction="custom-action">
  When this button shows interest, the below div will display.
</button>

<div id="my-custom">Supplementary information</div>

<script>
  const custom = document.getElementById("my-custom");
  custom.addEventListener("interest", (e) => {
    if (e.action !== "custom-action") return;
    custom.classList.add('active')
  });
  custom.addEventListener("loseinterest", (e) => {
    if (e.action !== "custom-action") return;
    custom.classList.remove('active')
  });
</script>
```

### Usability

The events `interest` and `loseinterest` are intentionally abstract to allow
more complex usability concepts to unfold. One such area being explored is
the ability to add "safe areas" or "hit triangles", which allow the user to
move the pointer between the Interest Invoker (e.g. the button) and Interestee
(e.g. the tooltip). See [#963](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/963)
for more.

### Accessibility

> Warning: This section is TBD. PRs and discussions welcome.

### Defaults

Depending on the target set by `interesttarget`, showing interest or losing
interest can trigger additional behaviours alongside the event dispatch.
Showing/losing interest on an interesttarget will _always_ dispatch a trusted
`InterestEvent`, but in addition the following table represents how interest on
specific element types are handled. Note that this list is ordered and higher
rules take precedence:

When the `interestaction` attribute is missing it will default to an auto state.

| Interestee Element | `action` hint    | Event Type       | Behaviour                            |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<* popover=*>`    | (auto)           | `'interest'`     | Call `.showPopover()` on the invokee |
| `<* popover=*>`    | `togglePopover`  | `'interest'`     | Call `.showPopover()` on the invokee |
| `<* popover=*>`    | (auto)           | `'loseinterest'` | Call `.hidePopover()` on the invokee |
| `<* popover=*>`    | `togglePopover`  | `'loseinterest'` | Call `.hidePopover()` on the invokee |

> Note: The above table is an attempt at wide coverage, but ideas are welcome. Please submit a PR if you have one!

### PAQ (Potentially Asked Questions)

#### Why the name `interest`? Why not `hover` or `focus`?

Much like `click`, `hover` or `focus` are specific to certain types of HID, and
are not terms which encompass all viable methods of interaction. Lots of
[alternatives were discussed](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/767) and
it was deemed that `interest` is the best name to explain the concept of a
"hover or focus or equivalent".

#### Why is `interesttarget` on a lot more elements than `invoketarget`?

While _invocation_ should only be limited to buttons, disclosure of
supplementary information can be expanded to _all_ interactive elements. There
are many useful use cases for offering a tooltip on anchors, such as signalling
that they are external, or that they will open in a new window, or to show
preview information (think: preview windows on iOS Safari or the hovercards that
display on GitHub over a user's handle).

#### Why is `interesttarget` not unlimited, like `title` is?

It could be considered a mistake to allow `title` on all elements; as adding
interactivity to non-interactive elements creates many problems. Limiting where
`interesttarget` is allowed aims to create a "pit of success", guiding
developers to use it only on interactive elements, where it makes sense.
