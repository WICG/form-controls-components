# Interest Invokers

## Pitch in Code

```html
<button interesttarget="my-tooltip">Hover/Focus to show the tooltip</button>

<span popover=hint id="my-toolip">This is the tooltip</span>
```

## Introduction

Following [invokers](../invokers.explainer), adding an `interesttarget`
attribute to interactive elements: starting with `<button>`, `<input
type="button">`/`<input type="reset">`, and `<a>` (perhaps expanding to
`<area>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<summary>` or maybe more, see
[#14](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/908)). This would allow
disclosure of high fidelity tooltips in a more accessible and declarative way.
Elements with `interesttarget` will - when hovered, long pressed, or focussed -
dispatch an `InterestEvent` on the element referenced by `interesttarget`, with
some default behaviours.

### Terms

- Interest/Shows Interest: The action of _Interest_ refers to the user "landing"
  on an element without invoking it, using a HID. If the HID is a mouse, this
  would be a `hover` event. If the HID is a touch screen, this would be a long
  press on the element using a stylus or finger, if the HID is a keyboard, this
  would be when the element is focussed. For other HIDs such as eye tracking or
  pedals or game controllers, the equivalent "focus or hover" action is used to
  take interest on the element.
- Loses/Lost Interest: The action of _Loses Interest_ refers to the user "moving
  away" from an element, or its _interestee_, using a HID; in other words
  interest must be on a different element that is neither. Elements can only
  _Lose Interest_ if they are in the state of Showing Interest. If the HID is a
  mouse, this would be a `mouseout` event. If the HID is a touch screen, this
  would be long pressing outside of the elements bounds. If the HID is a
  keyboard, this would be moving focus away from the element. For other HIDs
  such as eye tracking or game controllers, the equivalent "focusout or
  mouseout" action is used to _Lose Interest_ on the element.
- Interestee: An element which is referenced to by an Interest element, via the
  `interesttarget` attribute.

## Proposed Plan

In the style of `invoketarget`, this document proposes we add `interesttarget`
as an available attribute to `interesttarget` attribute to `<button>`, `<a>`,
`<area>` and `<input>` elements.

```webidl
interface mixin InvokerElement {
  [CEReactions] attribute Element? invokeTargetElement;
  [CEReactions] attribute DOMString invokeAction;
};
HTMLButtonElement extends InvokerElement
HTMLInputElement extends InvokerElement
```

The `interesttarget` value should be an IDREF pointing to an element within the
document. `.interestTargetElement` also exists on the element to imperatively
assign a node to be the invoker target, allowing for cross-root invokers (in
some cases, see [the popovertarget attr-asociated element
steps](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#attr-associated-element)
for more).

Elements with `interesttarget` set will dispatch an `InterestEvent` on the
_Interestee_ (the element referenced by `interesttarget`) when the element
_Shows Interest_ or _Loses Interest_. When the element _Shows Interest_ the
event type will be `'interest'`. If the element has _Shown Interest_, and
interest moves away from both the _Interest Element_ and the _Interestee_, then
the element _Loses Interest_ and an `InterestEvent` with the type of
`'loseinterest'` will be dispatched on the _Interestee_. The event also contains
a `relatedTarget` property that will reference the _Interest_ element.
`InterestEvents` are always non-bubbling, cancellable events.

```webidl
[Exposed=Window]
interface InterestEvent : Event {
  constructor(DOMString type, InterestEventInit interestEventInit);
  readonly attribute Element invoker;
};
dictionary InterestEventInit : EventInit {
  Element invoker;
};
```

Both `interesttarget` and `invoketarget` can exist on the same element at the
same time, and both should be respected.

If a `<button>` is a form participant, or has `type=submit`, then `invoketarget`
_must_ be ignored. `interesttarget` is still valid in these scenarios.

If an `<input>` is a form participant, or has a `type` other than `reset` or
`button`, then `invoketarget` and `interesttarget` _must_ be ignored. `interesttarget`
additionally works with `type` of `submit`.

### Example Code

#### Popovers

An `interesttarget` allows for tooltips using `popover`:

```html
<button interesttarget="my-popover">Open Popover</button>

<div id="my-popover" popover="hint">Hello world</div>
```

#### Custom behaviour

Elements with _Interest_ will dispatch events on the _Interestee_ element,
allowing for custom JavaScript to be triggered without having to wire up manual
event handlers to the Interest elements.

```html
<button interesttarget="my-custom">
  When this button shows interest, the below div will display.
</button>

<div id="my-custom" hidden>Supplementary information</div>

<script>
  const custom = document.getElementById("my-custom");
  custom.addEventListener("interest", (e) => {
    custom.hidden = false;
  });
  custom.addEventListener("loseinterest", (e) => {
    custom.hidden = true;
  });
</script>
```

### Usability

The events `interest` and `loseinterest` are intentionally abstract to allow
more complex usability concepts to unfold. For example browsers may design in a
delay to the events, or not change the "hit areas" for when a pointer moves in
or out of the Interest Invoker, to aid in usability. One option being explored
is the ability to add "safe areas" or "hit triangles", which allow the user to
move the pointer between the Interest Invoker (e.g. the button) and Interestee
(e.g. the tooltip). See [#963](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/963)
for more.

### Accessibility

> Warning: This section is TBD. PRs and discussions welcome.

### Defaults

Depending on the target set by `interesttarget`, showing interest or losing
interest can trigger additional behaviours alongside the event dispatch.
Showing/losing interest on an interesttarget will _always_ dispatch a trusted
`InterestEvent`, but in addition the following table represents how interest on
specific element types are handled. Note that this list is ordered and higher
rules take precedence:

| Interestee Element | Event Type       | Behaviour                            |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `<* popover=hint>` | `'interest'`     | Call `.showPopover()` on the invokee |
| `<* popover=hint>` | `'loseinterest'` | Call `.hidePopover()` on the invokee |

> Note: The above table is an attempt at wide coverage, but ideas are welcome. Please submit a PR if you have one!

### PAQ (Potentially Asked Questions)

#### Why the name `interest`? Why not `hover` or `focus`?

Much like `click`, `hover` or `focus` are specific to certain types of HID, and
are not terms which encompass all viable methods of interaction. Lots of
[alternatives were discussed](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/767) and
it was deemed that `interest` is the best name to explain the concept of a
"hover or focus or equivalent".

#### Why is `interesttarget` on a lot more elements than `invoketarget`?

While _invocation_ should only be limited to buttons, disclosure of
supplementary information can be expanded to _all_ interactive elements. There
are many useful use cases for offering a tooltip on anchors, such as signalling
that they are external, or that they will open in a new window, or to show
preview information (think: preview windows on iOS Safari or the hovercards that
display on GitHub over a user's handle).

#### Why is `interesttarget` not unlimited, like `title` is?

It could be considered a mistake to allow `title` on all elements; as adding
interactivity to non-interactive elements creates many problems. Limiting where
`interesttarget` is allowed aims to create a "pit of success", guiding
developers to use it only on interactive elements, where it makes sense.
