## Overview

The number component is a control that allows the user to enter a number, integer or decimal. It is a variation of the text input component, but with extra validation and optionally increment/decrement controls.

### Use Cases

The number component is primarily leveraged to indicate a numeric value. For example, forms could use a number input to enter a quantity of items.

| ---------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `min`            | `number` | `null`        | The minimum valid value of the input.                                                                    |

| `step`           | `number` | `null`        | The amount that the value changes when editing using keyboard arrows or UI.                              |
| `value`          | `number` | `null`        | The value of the checkbox.                                                                               |

| `disabled`       | `bool`   | `false`       | Prevents the user from interacting with the control. Defaults to false.                                  |
| `form`           | `string` | `null`        | Associates the element with a form in the document whose `id` is this value.                             |

### Anatomy

<InputNumberAnatomy />

### Explanation

The proposed anatomy of the number component is based on the existing `<input type="number">` element. Which shares the same anatomy across all desktop implementations.

The spinner part of the component is not universal, for example mobile implementations of the number input do not have a spinner. However, the spinner is a useful affordance for desktop users, so it is included in the anatomy.
Implementations should consider the default styles given to the spinner parts.
