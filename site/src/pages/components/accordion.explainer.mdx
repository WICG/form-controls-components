# Background

A **disclosure** widget
([research](/components/disclosure.research))
is a UI that shows a summary or heading along
with an indicator (sometimes a triangle or a plus sign) that allows the
widget to be expanded to show additional details.
An **accordion**
([research](/components/accordion.research))
is a sequence of related disclosure widgets.
Some accordions are **exclusive accordions**,
which means that at most one of the disclosures in that accordion
can be open at the same time.

The existing HTML
[`details` element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/C#the-details-element)
represents a disclosure widget.
A sequence of `details` elements can be used for a non-exclusive accordion.
However, there is not a current web platform feature
for exclusive accordions.

It is worth noting that the HTML `details` element
is not currently as styleable as it needs to be to meet many use cases.
Improving styleability of `details` will be addressed in a separate proposal,
intended to address both better ability to style/replace the disclosure triangle,
and (maybe separately) to fit the parts of a `details`
into different types of layout (such as grid).
For example, there is no standardized or interoperable way to
replace the disclosure triangle's image or to change its placement
relative to the summary or the rest of the content of the details.

# Developer Demand for Exclusive Accordion

Design systems that offer accordion widgets vary
as to whether those widgets are exclusive or not.
Based on the systems documented in the
[accordion research](/components/accordion.research),
it seems more common for them not to be exclusive,
however, some systems offer an option for being exclusive,
and some systems offer only exclusive accordions.

Some examples of exclusive accordions on live sites:
* [Pixel 7 product page](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_7?hl=en-US) on the Google Store (one accordion in each of the sections on Performance, Photography and Video, Protection, and Pixel Portfolio)
* [Parsons Table product page](https://www.roomandboard.com/catalog/dining-and-kitchen/tables/parsons-tables) at Room and Board (Style/Size/Top/Base accordion on right side of page)
* ...

# User Needs

Developers regularly use exclusive accordions on the Web.
Today, that generally means that they build their own widget
rather than using a widget provided by the platform,
because there is no such widget.

This proposal is suggesting that we add features for exclusive accordions
to the platform.
Doing so would help users because
it would make (or at least would enable making)
the user experience
more consistent, and generally better, in a number of areas:
* keyboard shortcuts and focus handling,
* exposure via ARIA to assistive technology, and
* integration with browser features such as find-in-page.

Reducing the need for developers to build their own widgets
should also reduce the size of pages that use such widgets,
which reduces the time and bandwidth needed
for users to load those pages.

# Proposal

I propose to add an attribute to
[the `details` element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/C#the-details-element).
All `details` elements in the same tree
that have the same value for this attribute
would form an exclusive accordion.
The syntax of this attribute and the rules for matching its values would match
[the `name` attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/C#naming-form-controls:-the-name-attribute)
and its use in defining
[radio button groups](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/C#radio-button-group).

When these attributes are used to form a group, it means that
any user action or API that causes one of the `details` elements
in the group to open causes all other elements in the group to close.

## Open design questions

### Name

There are many options for naming this attribute,
and they differ as to how well they:
* are concise,
* indicate that something happens when multiple elements use the same value, and
* indicate that the attribute causes the grouped elements
  to become exclusive (so that only one can be open).

Choices for its name also differ as to whether they're already used
for other things in HTML.
(This could be either an advantage or a disadvantage.)
In particular, `name` is used for grouping related form controls.

Some possibilities for the attribute's name are
`name`, `group`, or `exclusive`.

### Interaction with `open` attribute

Should this grouping cause the insertion of a `details` element with
the `open` attribute already set to have the `open` attribute removed
if it would violate the grouping constraint?
If so, is such attribute removal on insertion acceptable
(both for its complexity and for conformance with architectural principles)?
If not, is it ok that we allow developers a loophole to
violate the exclusivity semantics?

(This applies both to insertion by the parser
and insertion through other methods like setting `innerHTML`.)

### Changes to ARIA roles or keyboard behavior

It's possible that the presence of a group should
change the ARIA roles for the `details` or its `summary`
or change their default keyboard behavior.

If this is the case,
it seems likely that such changes
may also be desirable for non-exclusive accordions (see next question).

### Use case for non-exclusive accordion semantic?

This design assumes that there isn't a use case for
the semantic of a non-exclusive accordion,
since a non-exclusive accordion is largely indistinguishable
from a sequence of disclosures (`details` elements).

However, it's possible there may be value in
establishing such a semantic connection
between the `details` elements
in a non-exclusive accordion.
(See previous question for one possible reason.)

If such connection is valuable,
then that would favor a design that separates the ideas
of connecting the `details` elements into a group
and making the group exclusive.

## Possibly-resolved design questions

### Scope

Should the name be scoped
to something smaller than the document (for example, only to siblings)
or to something larger than the document (such as the flat tree)?

I think scoping only to siblings would be problematic
because there are valid use cases
for putting each `details` element into some sort of sectioning markup,
and that scoping on the flat tree would be problematic because
having names cross shadow root boundaries would break encapsulation.

# Alternatives considered

## CSS Toggles

The [CSS Toggles](https://tabatkins.github.io/css-toggle/) proposal
is a much more complex proposal that would be able to describe
exclusive accordions and many other things.
However, it has a number of issues related to developer experience,
accessibility, and other things, and it's not clear whether the proposal
is viable.
