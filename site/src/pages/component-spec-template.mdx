| `decrement(value: number = this.step): void` | Decrements the `value` of the component by the amount specified by `step`, clamped within `min`/`max` values. |

#### Events

_Example Table_

| Event Name | Detail Type | Bubbles | Composed | Cancellable | Dispatch Behavior                        |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `change`   | none        | `true`  | `true`   | `false`     | Fired when the slider's `value` changes. |

### Appearance

_Screenshots and/or description of the basic appearance of the component._

### Anatomy

_Outline the component's structure with a diagram of its render tree. Enumerate key areas of visual composition and customization._

#### Diagram

_Example_

![Example Diagram](../images/spec-diagram-example.png)

#### DOM Structure

_Define the recommended DOM to represent the component's anatomy, as shown above. Show how important attributes (aria attributes especially) are applied to the various parts. In cases where a component nests other components, expand the full DOM structure to understand the expectation and any shortcomings in the child components' customizability._

#### Slots

_What parts of the component are composable or replaceable?_

_Example Table_

| Slot Name | Description                                                        | Fallback Content                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `thumb`   | Enables replacing the component's `thumb` part with custom markup. | A default thumb implementation is provided. |

#### Host Classes

_What classes does the component add to the host element?_

| Class Name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |

#### Slotted Content Classes

_What classes on slotted content does the component respond to?_

| Class Name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |

#### CSS Parts

_What parts of the component are exposed for styling?_

_Example Table_

| Part Name | Description                                                                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `thumb`   | Enables styling the `thumb` part without requiring it to be completely replaced via its slot. |

## Behavior

### States and Interactions

_List key component states, valid state transitions, and how interactions trigger state transitions._

- _Are states changed as a result of keyboard? mouse? touch?_
- _Are there corresponding keyboard interactions for mouse/touch interactions?_
- _Are some events triggered on key down vs key press?_

_Example Table_

| State Group | States         | Initial State | Description                                                                                                           | Interaction/Transition                       |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `disabled`  | `true`/`false` | `false`       | When `true`, disables the control, preventing user interaction and displaying the control with a disabled appearance. | No interaction. Controlled programmatically. |

### Accessibility

_Consider the accessibility of the component._

#### Keyboard Navigation and Focus

- _Arrow vs tabbing key behavior_
- _Modifier key effects (e.g. shift, ctrl, meta)_
- _Does this component use focus delegation?_

_Example Table_

| Key       | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Up/Right  | Increments the value of the component by calling the `increment` method. If the `shift` modifier is pressed, increases by 10x the `step` value. |
| Down/Left | Decrements the value of the component by calling the `decrement` method. If the `shift` modifier is pressed, decreases by 10x the `step` value. |

#### Form Input

_Does this component integrate with form submission, form validation, etc.? Can integration be accomplish with standard APIs or are special work-arounds required?_

#### Use with Assistive Technology

_Are there any details about shadow dom, focus delegation, or aria attributes that need special attention?_

### Globalization

_Consider whether the component has any special globalization needs such as:_

- _Special RTL handling_
- _Swapping of internal icons/visuals_
- _Localization_

### Security

_Are there any security implications surrounding the component?_

### Performance

_Are there any performance pitfalls or challenges with implementing the component? (examples below)_

- If the component renders a loop of items, should certain areas be considered for virtualization?
- If the component needs to measure an area before rendering, how will jank be avoided?
- If any measuring is needed at all, can rAF techniques help queue measures and prevent synchronous reflows?

## Dependencies

_Will implementing the component require taking on any dependencies?_

- _3rd party libraries_
- _Upcoming standards we need to polyfill_
- _Do any dependencies bring along an associated timeline?_

### Platform Requirements

_Are there any core web platform features that are needed to implement this component well?_

### Tooling

_Are there any special considerations for DevTools? Will tooling changes need to be made? Is there a special way to light up this component in DevTools that would be compelling for developers/designers?_

## Resources

_Any related resource links such as web standards, discussion threads, diagrams, etc._
