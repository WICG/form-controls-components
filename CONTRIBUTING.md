# Open UI Community Group

This repository is being used for work in the W3C Open UI Community Group, governed by the [W3C Community License
Agreement (CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/). To make substantive contributions,
you must join the [Open UI CG]([https://www.w3.org/community/openui/](https://www.w3.org/community/open-ui/)).

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.

If you'd like to contribute a proposal, we offer guidance on our site's [getting involved](https://open-ui.org/get-involved) page. It details the process of standardizing a UI component, including research, proposals, and review.
