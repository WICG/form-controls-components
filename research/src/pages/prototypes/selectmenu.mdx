# &lt;selectmenu&gt;

Based on the [select](../components/select) proposal, the implementation of a new `<selectmenu>` control has started in [Chromium](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5737365999976448).
This control is available in Chromium-based browsers by enabling the **Experimental Web Platform features** experiment in about:flags.

## Help test the control

`<selectmenu>` is not ready for production use yet, but we value your feedback if you want to spend some time testing it. By being an early tester, you can actively help us make the control better for everyone. Read the documentation below to learn how to use the control.

If you encouter bugs or limitations with the design of the control, please send your feedback by [creating issues on the open-ui GitHub repository](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/new?title=[select]%20&labels=select) (prefixing your issue title with `[select]`).

## Anatomy of the selectmenu

Because the various parts of the selectmenu can be styled, it's important to understand the anatomy of this UI control.

<SelectAnatomy />

- `<select>` - The root element that contains the button and listbox.
- `<button>` - The button element that triggers the visibility of the listbox.
- `<selected-value>` - The element that displays the value of the currently selected option (optional).
- `<listbox>` - The wrapper that contains the `<option>`(s) and `<optgroup>`(s).
- `<optgroup>` - Groups `<option>`(s) together with a label (optional).
- `<option>` - Can have one or more and represents the potential values that can be chosen by the user.

## Default behavior

The default behavior of the `<selectmenu>` control mimics the behavior of the `<select>` control. You can use it just like a native `<select>`, with the following minimal markup:

```html
<selectmenu>
  <option>Option 1</option>
  <option>Option 2</option>
  <option>Option 3</option>
</selectmenu>
```

When doing so, the default button, select-value, and listbox are created for you.

## Styling parts of the control

One way to style the control to match your requirements is to use the CSS `::part()` pseudo-element to select the different parts within the control's anatomy that you wish to style.

```css
/* Make the button red with white text. */
.my-select-menu::part(button) {
  color: white;
  background-color: #f00;
}

/* Change the listbox's padding and border */
.my-select-menu::part(listbox) {
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid red;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```

`::part()` can be used to style the `button`, `selected-value`, and `listbox` parts of the control.

## Use your own markup

To further customize the control to fit your needs, you can provide your own markup to replace the default one, as well as extend the existing parts.

### Slotting your own markup

A `<selectmenu>` has named [slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots#adding_flexibility_with_slots)
that can be referenced to replace the default `button` or `listbox` parts. For example, to replace
the default button with your own, you can do the following:

```html
<style>
  .custom-button {
    /* Styles for my custom button */
  }
</style>
<selectmenu>
  <div slot="button">
    <div behavior="button" class="custom-button">
      My custom button
      <img src="/my-custom-button-icon.jpg" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <option>Option 1</option>
  <option>Option 2</option>
  <option>Option 3</option>
</selectmenu>
```

The `slot="button"` attribute on the outer `<div>` tells the `<selectmenu>` to replace its default
button with the contents of that `<div>`.

The `behavior="button"` attribute on the inner `<div>` tells the browser that this element is what
we want to use as the new button. The browser will automatically apply all the behavior to this
element that we expect for a select menu's button, like click and keyboard handlers that open the
listbox and the appropriate accessibility semantics.

You can replace the default listbox in a similar fashion:

```html
<style>
  .custom-listbox {
    /* Styles for my custom listbox */
  }
</style>
<selectmenu>
  <div slot="listbox">
    <popup behavior="listbox" class="custom-listbox">
      <option>Option 1</option>
      <option>Option 2</option>
      <option>Option 3</option>
    </popup>
</selectmenu>
```

The `<popup>` used here is the element proposed at
[Popup (Editor's Draft)](http://localhost:8000/components/popup). The element with
`behavior="listbox"` is required to be a `<popup>`. Applying `behavior="listbox"` tells the browser
to apply select menu listbox behavior to that element: it will be opened when the `<selectmenu>`'s
button is clicked, and the user can select `<option>`s inside it with mouse, arrow keys, and touch.
