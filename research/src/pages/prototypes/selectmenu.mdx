# selectmenu

Based on the [select](../components/select) proposal, the implementation of a new `<selectmenu>` control has started in [Chromium](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5737365999976448).
This control is available in Chromium-based browsers by enabling the **Experimental Web Platform features** experiment in about:flags.

## Help test the control

`<selectmenu>` is not ready for production use yet, but we value your feedback if you want to spend some time testing it. By being an early tester, you can actively help us make the control better for everyone. Read the documentation below to learn how to use the control.

If you encouter bugs or limitations with the design of the control, please send your feedback by [creating issues on the open-ui GitHub repository](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues) (prefixing your issue title with `[select]`).

## Anatomy of the selectmenu

Because the various parts of the selectmenu can be styled, it's important to understand the anatomy of this UI control.

<SelectAnatomy />

- `<select>` - The root element that contains the button and listbox.
- `<button>` - The button element that contains the selected value and triggers the visibility of the listbox.
- `<selected-value>` - The element that displays the selected value text.
- `<listbox>` - The wrapper that contains the `<option>`(s) and `<optgroup>`(s).
- `<optgroup>` - Groups `<option>`(s) together with a label (optional).
- `<option>` - Can have one or more and represents the potential values that can be chosen by the user.

## Default behavior

The default behavior of the `<selectmenu>` control mimics the behavior of the `<select>` control. You can use it just like a native `<select>`, with the following minimal markup:

```html
<selectmenu>
  <option>Option 1</option>
  <option>Option 2</option>
  <option>Option 3</option>
</selectmenu>
```

When doing so, the default button, select-value, and listbox are created for you.

## Styling parts of the control

One way to style the control to match your requirements is to use the CSS `::part()` pseudo-element to select the different parts within the control's anatomy that you wish to style.

```css
/* Make the button red with white text. */
.my-select-menu::part(button) {
  color: white;
  background-color: #f00;
}

/* Change the listbox's padding and border */
.my-select-menu::part(listbox) {
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid red;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```

`::part()` can be used to style the `button`, `selected-value`, and `listbox` parts of the control.

## Use your own markup

To further customize the control to fit your needs, you can provide your own markup to replace the default one, as well as extend the existing parts.
