# File Input Component Specification

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The File Input component is a control that provides the user with the ability
to select local files.

### Background <a href="#background" id="background"></a>

File Input controls are widely used and implemented on the web. They are as of
today, the only thing that allows an application to access the local file
system, in a fairly limited but controlled way.

### Use Cases <a href="#use-cases" id="use-cases"></a>

The `<input type=file>` control is widely used to provide applications with the
capability of reading local files on form submission, or uploading files to a
server.

#### Stylability

Authors may want to replace the `&lt;button>` or `&lt;label>` contents.

<Image
  alt="Example of an input with both replaced button and label contents"
  src="file-replaced-contents.png"
/>

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

The main feature is selecting local files, potentially receiving hints from the
website about which file kinds are allowed, for example.

### Prior Art/Examples <a href="#prior-art" id="prior-art"></a>

#### Browser implementations

Browsers show an interoperable rendering for file inputs, consisting of a
button and a label.

- WebKit and Blink use an `<input type=button>`, and a magical label that
  doesn't show up in the DOM.

- Gecko uses an actual `<button tabindex=-1>` and an HTML `<label>` element.

Those three implementations use some form of middle-cropping when the selected
file name is too large.

#### Custom inputs on the web

Custom inputs on the web are generally achieved by hiding the original input.
Some approach it by hiding it in a way that the user can still hit (like
`opacity: 0`), others use JS to forward the click from some other UI element to
the underlying file input.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#file-browser)
  uses the former approach, by generating a "Browse" button with generated
  content.

- [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/file-uploader/code/)
  uses the later.

#### Properties and Attributes <a href="#properties-attributes" id="properties-attributes"></a>

### Appearance <a href="#appearance" id="appearance"></a>

### Anatomy <a href="#anatomy" id="anatomy"></a>

#### Diagram <a href="#diagram" id="diagram"></a>

TODO

#### DOM Structure <a href="#dom-structure" id="dom-structure"></a>

```html
<button tabindex="-1" part="file-selector-button">
  <slot name="button">
    <!-- Localized "Browse..." string -->
  </slot>
</button>
<label part="file-selector-label">
  <slot name="label">
    <!-- implementation and state-dependent -->
  </slot>
</label>
```

The button is not tab-navigable, as the input is focused atomically, see below.

#### CSS Parts <a href="#css-parts" id="css-parts"></a>

| Part Name              | Description                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file-selector-button` | Enables styling the `&lt;button>` part without requiring it to be completely replaced via its slot. |
| `file-selector-label`  | Enables styling the `&lt;label>` part without requiring it to be completely replaced via its slot.  |

## Behavior <a href="#behavior" id="behavior"></a>

### States and Interactions <a href="#states-interactions" id="states-interactions"></a>

- As a result of keyboard (either Enter or Spacebar without modifier) or mouse
  / touch interaction (click), an implementation-dependent dialog will show
  up. This dialog cannot be accessed by the website, but its contents and
  appearance may depend on things like the `accept` attribute.

- Dragging an file into the component may also be used to select a particular
  file.

## Accessibility <a href="#accessibility" id="accessibility"></a>

File Inputs should be focusable via a keyboard navigation.

#### Keyboard Navigation and Focus <a href="#keyboard-navigation" id="keyboard-navigation"></a>

File input is focused atomically.

<p class="question">

Seems like ideally we could delegate focus to the button, or something something... Gecko used to
do that, but I had to change it because the button exists as a result of layout (in Gecko, at
least, that is). Also input type changes would be trickier with such a setup.
See <a href="https://github.com/WICG/open-ui/issues/107">Issue #107</a>

</p>

#### Form Input <a href="#form-input" id="form-input"></a>

This component integrates naturally with form submission as described in [the HTML spec](<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#file-upload-state-(type=file)>).

### Globalization <a href="#globalization" id="globalization"></a>

The component reacts naturally to directionality. The initial label content and
the button contents should be localized.

### Security <a href="#security" id="security"></a>

The component very intentionally doesn't expose to the outside world anything
in the local file system that hasn't been chosen by the user.

## Next Steps <a href="#next-steps" id="next-steps"></a>

_What next steps, if any, are there? Is there some functionality that would be a nice-to-have or a common feature in other implementations that could be added but is not considered part of the MVP? Link all feature additions, modifications, bugs, or editorial change issues._
