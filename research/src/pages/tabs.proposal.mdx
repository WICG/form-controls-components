# Tabs Component Specification

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

*Tabs* are a set of sections of content that display one panel of content at a time. Each tab panel has an associated tab element, that when activated, displays the panel. The list of tab elements is arranged along one edge of the currently displayed panel.

### Background <a href="#background" id="background"></a>

'Tabs' as a user interface component have a long history and continued evolution.  
    
Long before there were computers, humans tried to organize information in way that made it easier to find what you're looking for.  One popular solution to this involved arranging things  with into labeled groups that could be quickly scanned and navigated. "File folders" with a raised (and often alternating location) label was an especially popular affordance.

[By at least 1982](https://books.google.com/books?id=e-gI2W-3JwkC&lpg=PA212&pg=PA214#v=onepage&q&f=false)(before there were popular graphical interfaces), programs began using ASCII art constructs to attempt to apply this analogy to navigating digital information.

Graphical user interfaces continued to commonly explore this idea in interesting variants and develop related ideas.  Generally speaking, the basic, core notion of "tabs" was common enough that it was uniquely defineable in the new "Accessibility Trees" that were developed to make operating system controls accessible.  The W3C's acecssibility initiative was created to provide a way to map web contents and controls to the underlying trees. The [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#intro_ria_accessibility) defines a similar tree, inspired and informed by the OS-level trees and thus from the start included definitions of the necessary roles, states and properties to describe tabs. The W3C's [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) additionally describes the functional requirements of tabs (keyboard handling, focus management and management of WAI-ARIA's roles, states and properties) necessary to create accessible tabs.  

As toolkits and operating systems evolved they also developed several specializations  with various additional qualities and different guidance on when they should be used.  Tabbed document interfaces, for example, were created as a way to mange windows in an applicaion and therefore needed the qualities of a window (the ability to move it, close it, derive its title and associated icon, and so on), simply drawn in an interface that "looked" like tab groups.  Ribbons (as some would think of them today) combined ideas of tab and (sometimes scrollable) toolbar interfaces which can sometimes be minimized (hidden), but not dismissed.  Mobile interfaces also introduced intersting new challenges.  There are several components with very similar base needs which are somewhat fluid and constantly evolving in systems in terms of exactly what they are called or what visual criteria distinquish them (accordions and tabs, for example, are differentiated in some toolkits and systems in various ways - sometimes functional in which the important bit is in how many can be active at once, and sometimes purely visual).

Because this was all true while the WHATWG took up HTML 5, and there were even markup oriented expressions of several of these components in systems like XUL, XAML and Flex,  the HTML specification briefly included an element known as [`<switch>`](https://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2006-01-01/#switch) but this was removed in 2006.  

In 2015, several W3C participants got together to try to [propose work toward a standard solution through WICG](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/panels-and-panelsets/1184) for several of these use cases.  While a fair amount of the accessibility community was interested in pursuing this, the effort ultimately failed for a number of reasons, technical limitations at the time (no wide Shadow DOM availability and the rise of frameworks with their own lifecycles greatly increased the difficulties of a really great implementation).  While it got use and feedback, it was quite limited and after some experience, eventually dropped as a proposal.  

It remains a frequently requested HTML element from developers, both [formally](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1809) and via social media and blog posts.


### Use Cases <a href="#use-cases" id="use-cases"></a>

- Steve is researching for an upcoming vacation for him and his family. He opens his web browser and opens a new tab to make a rental car reservation and another for his flight information. Steve can quickly switch back and fourth between tabs to get the information he needs for the rental car reservation.

- Monika visits a website to learn how to fix her leaky sink. The website displays a vertical tab interface with each step. Monika can jump ahead steps or go back to previous steps by selecting various tabs.

### Non-goals <a href="#non-goals" id="non-goals"></a>

_A list of use cases, features, or functionality which are **not** goals for the component._

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

- **Orientation:** Allows the tab list to be oriented horizontally above the tab content or vertically to the left or right (depending on language region) of the tab content.
- **Supplemental content:** Offers a way to add content via start and end to the left and/or right (depending on language region) of the the tab list.
- **ActiveIndicator:** Offers a way to add or remove an active indicator that highlights the currently active tab and animates to the next active tab. Defaults to true.
- **ActiveTab:** Provides a reference to the currently active tab vis the `change` event.
- **ActiveId:** Provides a way to set the active tab.

### Risks and Challenges <a href="#risks" id="risks"></a>

*Tabs* has specific guidance on DOM structure by the [WC3](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/tabs/tabs-2/tabs.html). This structure lacks logical groupings by separating the tab from its content. Some component libraries compensate for this by creating some kind of intermediary grouping that makes it easier for app authors to implement. Even though the DOM structure disassociates that logical grouping. While other component libraries stick to the DOM structure model. 

Some scenarios require an indicator that highlights the currently active tab then animates to the next activated tab. Most solutions rely on finding active tab's position on screen and then preforming some math to get the position. This works for most cases but if the tab list repositions itself either by window resizing or other layout changes the active indicator is no longer aligned properly.

## Behavior <a href="#behavior" id="behavior"></a>

### States and Interactions <a href="#states-interactions" id="states-interactions"></a>

*Tabs* can either be controlled or uncontrolled, meaning if `activeid` is passed the app author is taking control of the selected tab. When the `change` event fires it updates the `activeid` and pass a reference to the `activetab`.

_List key component states, valid state transitions, and how interactions trigger state transitions._

- _Are states changed as a result of keyboard? mouse? touch?_
- _Are there corresponding keyboard interactions for mouse/touch interactions?_
- _Are some events triggered on key down vs key press? On swipe?_

_Example Table_

| State Group | States         | Initial State | Description                                                                                                           | Interaction/Transition                       |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `disabled`  | `true`/`false` | `false`       | When `true`, disables the control, preventing user interaction and displaying the control with a disabled appearance. | No interaction. Controlled programmatically. |

### Accessibility <a href="#accessibility" id="accessibility"></a>

_Consider the accessibility of the component._

#### Keyboard Navigation and Focus <a href="#keyboard-navigation" id="keyboard-navigation"></a>

- _Arrow vs tabbing key behavior_
- _Modifier key effects (e.g. shift, ctrl, meta)_
- _Does this component use focus delegation?_
- _What is the behavior around disabled tabs?_
- _What is the behavior around tabs that move around in the UI (i.e. using flexbox order to move the active tab to be "first" in the tabgroup?_

- [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Keyboard Support](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/tabs/tabs-2/tabs.html#kbd_label)

_Example Table_

| Key       | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Up/Right  | Increments the value of the component by calling the `increment` method. If the `shift` modifier is pressed, increases by 10x the `step` value. |
| Down/Left | Decrements the value of the component by calling the `decrement` method. If the `shift` modifier is pressed, decreases by 10x the `step` value. |

#### Form Input <a href="#form-input" id="form-input"></a>

_Does this component integrate with form submission, form validation, etc.? Can integration be accomplish with standard APIs or are special work-arounds required?_

#### Use with Assistive Technology <a href="#assistive-tech" id="assistive-tech"></a>

_Are there any details about shadow dom, focus delegation, or aria attributes that need special attention?_

### Globalization <a href="#globalization" id="globalization"></a>

*Tabs* should mirror in RTL languages, meaning the tabs and tab content should flip direction.

### Security <a href="#security" id="security"></a>

_Are there any security implications surrounding the component?_

### Performance <a href="#performance" id="performance"></a>

_Are there any performance pitfalls or challenges with implementing the component? (examples below)_

- If the component renders a loop of items, should certain areas be considered for virtualization?
- If the component needs to measure an area before rendering, how will jank be avoided?
- If any measuring is needed at all, can rAF techniques help queue measures and prevent synchronous reflows?

## Dependencies <a href="#dependancies" id="dependancies"></a>

_Will implementing the component require taking on any dependencies?_

- _3rd party libraries_
- _Upcoming standards we need to polyfill_
- _Do any dependencies bring along an associated timeline?_
