<p class="todo">
  Add IDL to frontmatter (<a href="https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/356">#356</a>)
</p>

A `popup` element represents transient application UI that “pops up” in the top layer of a web
document, enabling the user to perform some task in a timely and immediate fashion. `popup` is
similar to the `dialog` element, but is distinguished by its transient nature (“light dismiss”
behaviors) and mutual exclusivity: only one `popup` element may be rendered at a time, with the
exception of nested `popup`s.

## Showing a `popup`

A `popup` element should not be shown to the user unless:

- The `initiallyopen` attribute is specified
- The `show()` method is invoked
- Or the `popup` element has been invoked via the `popup` attribute.

This requirement may be implemented indirectly through the style layer. For example,
user agents that
[support the suggested default rendering](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#renderingUA)
implement this requirement using the CSS rules described in the
[Rendering section](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#rendering).

### The `initiallyopen` attribute

The `initiallyopen` attribute is a
[boolean attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attribute).
When specified, it indicates that the `popup` element should be shown on document load, such that
the user can interact with it.

**Example:**

```html
<popup initiallyopen></popup>
```

If the `initiallyopen` attribute is specified, the user agent must run the following steps:

1. Let _subject_ be the `popup` element on which the `initiallyopen` attribute was specified.
2. Run the [Hide currently-shown `popup` elements steps](#hide-current-popups).
3. Add the _subject_ to _subject_'s
   [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document)'s
   [top layer](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer), at the top of the stack.
4. Set the `open` IDL attribute on the _subject_ to `true`.

<p class="question">
  This effectively means the last popup in the DOM order with initiallyopen specified will be the
  popup that "wins". Is that clear enough to implementers? Is that a reasonable behavior?
</p>

### The `show()` method

The `show()` method displays the `popup` element.

**Example:**

```html
<popup id="newFeatureUI">
  <p>
    <strong>New!</strong>
    I’m some sort of educational UI…
  </p>
</popup>

<script>
  if (upsellNewFeature) {
    document.getElementById('newFeatureUI').show()
  }
</script>
```

When `show()` is invoked, the user agent must run the following steps:

1. Let _subject_ be the `popup` element on which the method was invoked.
2. Run the [Hide currently-shown `popup` elements steps](#hide-current-popups).
3. Add the _subject_ to _subject_'s
   [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document)'s
   [top layer](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer), at the top of the stack.
4. Set the `open` IDL attribute on the _subject_ to `true`.

### The `popup` attribute

The `popup` attribute indicates that a related `popup` element should be shown or hidden as the
user interacts with the element where the `popup` attribute is specified. If the attribute is
specified, the attribute's value must be the ID of a `popup` element in the same
[node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document).

**Example:** Invoking the `button` element in this example should show/hide the `popup` element,
depending on whether or not the `popup` element is currently shown:

```html
<button id="menuButton" popup="menuPopup">Menu</button>
<popup id="menuPopup" role="menu" anchor="menuButton">
  <!-- Markup for menuitems goes here -->
</popup>
```

The `popup` attribute is supported on a subset of
[interactive elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html):

- `button`
- `input` in the `button` state
- `input` in the `text`, `email`, `phone`, or `url` states

Let _activating element_ be the element on which the `popup` attribute is specified. If the
_activating element_ is a `button` element or an `input` element in the `button` state, and the
_activating element_ is activated; OR the _activating element_ is an input in the `text`, `email`,
`phone`, or `url` states and focus is set to the _activating element_, the user agent must run the
following steps:

1. Let _subject_ be the element with the ID referenced by the `popup` attribute specified on the
   _subject_. If the _subject_ is not a `popup` element, then return.
2. If the `open` IDL attribute on the _subject_ is `true`, run
   [hiding a `popup` element steps](#hiding-current-popups).
3. Otherwise:
   1. Run the [Hide currently-shown `popup` elements steps](#hide-current-popups).
   2. Add the _subject_ to _subject_'s
      [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document)'s
      [top layer](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer), at the top of the stack.
   3. Set the `open` IDL attribute on the _subject_ to `true`.

<p class="todo">
  Probably need to specify some way of storing the relationship once subject is activated, for
  purposes of deciding whether to hide a popup.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Should we have a way to suppress these steps upon focus, so that the author can enable the popup
  to be shown upon text entry (or some other logic) instead?
</p>

<h4 id="hide-current-popups">
  Hide currently-shown <code>popup</code> elements steps
</h4>

Let _candidate subject_ be the new candidate `popup` element to be shown.
If applicable, let _activating element_ be the element whose `popup` attribute specifies the ID of
the _candidate subject_, and which has been activated by the user.
If applicable, let the _anchor element_ be the element whose ID is referenced by the `anchor`
specified on the _candidate subject_.

Starting at the bottom of the top-layer stack: for each `popup` element which has an `open` IDL
attribute set to `true`, and which is not the _candidate subject_:

1. Let _subject_ be the current `popup` element in the top-layer stack.
2. Walk the DOM to determine if the _subject_ is an ancestor to the _candidate subject_, the
   _activating element_, or the _anchor element_.
3. If the _subject_ is an ancestor, then return.
4. Otherwise, for this _subject_ and any other `popup`s higher in the stack, run the
   [Hiding a `popup` element steps](#hiding-current-popups).

<p class="todo">
  Step #2 probably needs to be more precise, and more specific about Shadow/light DOM
</p>

## Setting focus when a `popup` is shown

### The `autofocus` attribute

### The `delegatesfocus` attribute

## Anchoring a `popup` to another element

## Hiding a `popup` element

### The `hide()` method

### Light dismissal

<h3 id="hiding-popup-steps">
  Hiding a <code>popup</code> element steps
</h3>

1. Remove the _subject_ from the
   [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document)'s
   [top layer](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer).
2. Set the `open` IDL attribute on the _subject_ to `false`.
3. [Queue an element task](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#queue-an-element-task)
   on the [user interaction task source](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#user-interaction-task-source)
   given the _subject_ element to [fire a non-cancelable event](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-event-fire)
   named `hide` at _subject_.
