A `popup` element represents transient application UI that “pops up” in the top layer of a web
document, enabling the user to perform some task in a timely and immediate fashion. `popup` is
similar to the `dialog` element, but is distinguished by its transient nature (“light dismiss”
behaviors) and mutual exclusivity: only one `popup` element may be rendered at a time, with the
exception of nested `popup`s.

## Showing a `popup`

A `popup` element should not be shown to the user unless:

- The `initiallyopen` attribute is specified
- The `show()` method is invoked
- Or the `popup` element has been invoked via the `popup` attribute.

This requirement may be implemented indirectly through the style layer. For example,
user agents that
[support the suggested default rendering](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#renderingUA)
implement this requirement using the CSS rules described in the
[Rendering section](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#rendering).

### The `initiallyopen` attribute

The `initiallyopen` attribute is a
[boolean attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attribute).
When specified, it indicates that the `popup` element should be shown on document load, such that
the user can interact with it.

**Example:**

```html
<popup initiallyopen></popup>
```

If the `initiallyopen` attribute is specified, the user agent must run the following steps:

1. Let _subject_ be the `popup` element on which the `initiallyopen` attribute was specified.
2. Run the [Dismiss currently-shown `popup` elements steps](#dismiss-current-popups).
3. Add the _subject_ to _subject_'s
   [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document)'s
   [top layer](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer).
4. Set the `open` IDL attribute on the _subject_ to `true`.

<p class="question">
  This effectively means the last popup in the DOM order with initiallyopen specified will be the
  popup that "wins". Is that clear enough to implementers? Is that a reasonable behavior?
</p>

### The `show()` method

The `show()` method displays the `popup` element.

**Example:**

```html
<popup id="newFeatureUI">
  <p>
    <strong>New!</strong>
    I’m some sort of educational UI…
  </p>
</popup>

<script>
  if (upsellNewFeature) {
    document.getElementById('newFeatureUI').show()
  }
</script>
```

When `show()` is invoked, the user agent must run the following steps:

1. Let _subject_ be the `popup` element on which the method was invoked.
2. Run the [Dismiss currently-shown `popup` elements steps](#dismiss-current-popups).
3. Add the _subject_ to _subject_'s
   [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document)'s
   [top layer](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#top-layer).
4. Set the `open` IDL attribute on the _subject_ to `true`.

### The `popup` attribute

<h4 id="dismiss-current-popups">
  Dismiss currently-shown <code>popup</code> elements steps
</h4>

## Setting focus when a `popup` is shown

### The `autofocus` attribute

### The `delegatesfocus` attribute

## Anchoring a `popup` to another element

## Dismissing a `popup`

### The `hide()` method

### Light dismissal
