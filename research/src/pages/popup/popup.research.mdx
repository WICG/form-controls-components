A popup is a piece of transient UI that “pops up” over all other web app UI, i.e. “on the top layer”. A `popup` may be its own standalone element (such as a teaching bubble) or it may be part of a larger composited component (such as a combobox). Popups differ from other top-layer UI in that they are inherently transient: only one can be shown at a time unless chained by ancestry, and popups are dismissed upon “light dismiss” user interactions (e.g. sending focus out of the popup or hitting the ESC key). They can contain arbitrary content, including interactive descendents.

This research page gathers together various subclasses of popups into one collection. It is likely sensible to explore several of these concepts more deeply in additional Open UI components. It may also be reasonable to consider new web platform primitives/elements to handle specific but common types of popups. For now, the following are considered appropriate candidates for use of the [proposed `popup` element](/components/popup.research.explainer).

## Behaviors

- **Mutual exclusivity:** popups are inherently transient, and it is expected that a user would interact with only one at a time. Popups that are parented to another are the exception: for example, menu buttons with multiple levels of popup menus are a common paradigm.
- **Invocation:** popups could be said to have discrete `show()` and `hide()` methods, whether they are invoked by app logic or by interacting with other UI (including parts of the same component).
- **Light dismiss behaviors:** most popups "light dismiss", in that the following will dismiss the popup: pressing the ESC key, invoking elsewhere in the document, invoking another popup (unless it is a child of the currently opened popup).
- **Positioning:** popups are displayed in a top layer above all other UI, out of flow. They are often but not always anchored to another UI element's position.
- Popups may vary in: **focus behaviors:** for example, whether focus is trapped within the popup, whether focus is automatically sent to the popup and where exactly auto focused is placed, whether the tab/arrow keys are used to traverse content.

## Anatomy

Frequently, a popup is a part of a larger composite component, such as a select, a combobox, or a menu. A popup's anatomy will vary depending on the subclass of popup, and in some cases a popup can contain arbitrary content at the developer's discretion. Likewise, semantics may vary as well: particular subclasses of popups may require more specific semantic representation, and could be a candidate for further expansion of the web platform if appropriate.

## Overview of popup subclasses

These details document the reality of popups in implementation as opposed to suggesting a standard design.

| **Alert:** Important messages and status updates that are displayed on the web application layer, and should disrupt the user’s current task. Often these are status messages related to the action the user just took.                                                                                                                                 | `role="alert"` or `"role="status"`.

Sometimes: `<body>`. | Light dismiss (moving focus to dismiss doesn't apply when modal), completing the desired action. Sometimes: clicking a close button.                                                                           | Often yes. | Usually, middle of the viewport; highest stacking context.                                                                                                |
| **Menu:** Upon invoking some element, often a button, a popup containing menu items appears. The menu items are actions the user can take—e.g. edit, delete, favorite—vs links for navigation. Can have multiple layers of menu as nested popups. Cycling through menu items can change a value / text contents of another element in the host web app. | `role="menu"`, with children of various `menuitem` roles.                      | Usually by invoking an activating element. Sometimes additionally by hovering. Rarely by the activating element receiving focus. | Sometimes, upon invocation, focus on the first focusable child element of the popup. Often, focus remains on activating element and must be manually moved into popup.                                                                               | Light dismiss, selecting an option.                                                                                                                                                                            | No         | Anchored to activating element; highest stacking context.                                                                                                 |

| **Toast:** Often transient and disappear on a particular timeout                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `role="alert"` or `"role="status"`. Sometimes no special semantics             | App logic                                                                                                                        | Remains on active element. Toast may contain focusable elements (e.g. close button). Often inserted into an arbitrary point in the DOM (e.g. end of DOM).                                                                                            | Sometimes: auto-dismissed on a timeout. Usually: invoking a button.                                                                                                                                            | No         | Relative to viewport (corner); highest stacking context.                                                                                                  |
| **Tooltip:** A simple text label supporting another bit of UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `role="tooltip"`                                                               | Hovering over, focusing, or invoking an activating element.                                                                      | Hover/focus invocation: remains on activating element, often the tooltip is not reachable with keyboard focus. After invoking another element: remains on activating element, or moves to first focusable element in the tooltip.                    | Light dismiss. Sometimes: mousing out of activating element (if shown via hover). Sometimes: invoking activating element again (if shown via element invocation). Sometimes: invoking a “close” or “x” button. | No         | Relative to the activating element, often with control over cardinal direction of anchoring; highest stacking context.                                    |
