## Context

Per a [recent survey of over 1000 developers](http://gwhitworth.com/surveys/controls-components/),
`<select>` is the most re-created form control on the web today. While there are
[many reasons](https://github.com/WICG/open-ui/blob/master/platform/select/investigations/use-cases.md) one might
re-create a dropdown menu, the fact that `<select>` cannot be consistently styled cross-browser is the most prominent.
Quoting [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) (emphasis added):

> **The `<select>` element is notoriously difficult to style productively with CSS**. You can affect certain aspects
> like any element — for example, manipulating the box model, the displayed font, etc., and you can use the appearance
> property to remove the default system appearance.
>
> However, **these properties don't produce a consistent result across browsers**, and it is hard to do things like
> line different types of form element up with one another in a column. **The `<select>` element's internal structure
> is complex, and hard to control**. **If you want to get full control, you should consider using a library** with good
> facilities for styling form widgets (such as jQuery UI), **or try rolling your own dropdown menu** using non-semantic
> elements, JavaScript, and WAI-ARIA to provide semantics.

Consequently, the web is now rife with custom dropdowns, many of which are not accessible (i.e. lacking support for
AT, keyboard input, and high contrast), and that often provide a poor user experience. It must be emphasized that the
limitations of `<select>` are not just a problem for developers—they are just as much a problem for users.

To address these issues, we must standardize on a new `<select>`—one that developers can style and customize to their
needs, with accessibility and compatibility built in. A specification for such a control is proposed below.
Whether it's wanting to add an image to an option, wanting to allow the user to search the list of options, or even
something as seemingly trivial as wanting to change the selected option's background color—never again should a developer have
to rebuild the entire `<select>` from scratch for a basic UI or UX change.

## States / Properties

### &ltselect&gt

- **open** (_bool_): Controls whether the dropdown is open.

- **defaultOpen** (_bool_): The initial value for `open`. Defaults to false.

- **value** (_string_): The currently selected option.

- **multiple** (_bool_): Controls whether the user should be able to select multiple items. Defaults to false.

- **searchable** (_bool_): Controls whether the list of options can be searched. If true, a search field is added to
  the element, and the list of options is filtered by value (matching on prefix, case insensitive) unless
  overridden by onSearch. Defaults to false.

- **onSearch** (_function_): Callback function fired when the search input changes (`searchable` must be enabled).

- **onSelect** (_function_): Callback function fired when the selected option changes.

- **popupDirection** (_enum: auto | above | below_): Specify the direction the options list should pop up towards.
  "Auto" is the behavior of `<select>` today (pop up in the direction with the most screen real estate).

- **repeatScroll** (_bool_): Specify whether, while using arrow keys, the menu should scroll back to the first option
  after reaching the last option.

- **autofocus** (_bool_): Get focus by default.

- **disabled** (_bool_): Prevents the user from interacting with the control. Defaults to false.

- **name** (_string_): Specify the name of the control.

- **required** (_bool_): Indicates that an option must be selected.

### &ltoption&gt

- **disabled** (_bool_): Prevents the user from selecting this option. Defaults to false.

- **selected** (_bool_): Indicates that this option is initially selected (overrides the default of the
  first option being initially selected).

- **label** (_slot_): The HTML content of the option.

- **value** (_string_): The option's associated value (e.g. to be submitted with a form).

### &ltoptgroup&gt

- **disabled** (_bool_): Prevents the user from selecting any options in this option group. Defaults to false.

- **label** (_slot_): The HTML content of the option group.
