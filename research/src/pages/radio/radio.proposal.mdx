## Overview

The `<oui-radio>` element is a control that allows the user to select a single choice out of a set of choices. It has a binary "checked" state, either checked or unchecked (where "checked" is the selected choice, while all the other remain "unchecked".

Because the `<oui-radio>` is a choice from a set of choices, the choices are logically grouped by an implicit or explicit `<oui-radio-group>`. This proposal will deal with the existence of both elements, the different ways they can interact and their properties.

### Use Cases

The `<oui-radio-group>` is used in cases very similar to a `<select>` element, where the user is presented with a set of options from which they can select a single one.

Differently from `<select>`, where all the `<option>` are condensed into a single box, the `<oui-radio-group>` has all the `<oui-radio>` visible, readily available to be read and selected. Choosing between a `<select>` and `<oui-radio-group>` is a matter of layout and information density preference, in most cases.

Also differently from a `<select>`, there is currently no `multiple` attribute to allow a multiple choice group, and this document will not propose one for now.

## Radio Design

This section relates to a single `<oui-radio>`.

The radio can have a `disabled` attribute, meaning it's a possible choice, but that is currently unavailable.

If used inside a `<oui-radio-group>`, it gets implicitly bound to the group, becoming one of the choices. If declared outside of it, it should contain a `group` attribute equal to the group's `name` attribute.

It can also have a `required` or a `readonly` attribute. Because standalone radios with such attributes would not make much sense, by placing these attributes on a single `<oui-radio>`, the whole radio group would be understood as `required` or `readonly`, be it either an explicit or implicit group.

#### Properties

| Attribute Name   | Type     | Default Value | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checked`        | `bool`   | `false`       | Controls whether the radio is checked or unchecked.                                                  |
| `defaultChecked` | `bool`   | `false`       | The initial value for `checked`. Defaults to false.                                                  |
| `value`          | `string` | `null`        | The value of the radio (this is the value of a single possible choice).                              |
| `autofocus`      | `bool`   | `false`       | Get focus by default.                                                                                |
| `disabled`       | `bool`   | `false`       | Prevents the user from interacting with the control. Defaults to false.                              |
| `group`          | `string` | `null`        | Binds the radio to a radio group. While inside a radio group, it is implicitly defined.              |
| `form`           | `string` | `null`        | Associates the element with a form in the document whose `id` is this value.                         |
| `readonly`       | `bool`   | `false`       | Makes its group unavailable for user interaction, but the selected choice should still be submitted. |
| `required`       | `bool`   | `false`       | Makes its group required to have a selected choice.                                                  |

### Anatomy

<RadioButtonGroupAnatomy />

#### DOM Structure (Implicit Grouping)

The following structure represents a group with the `choices` slot filled with radios (their internal structures are omitted for brevity).

```html
<oui-radio-group name="group-name">
  <slot name="label">
    <label part="label"></label>
  </slot>
  <slot name="required-indicator">
    <div part="required-indicator"></div>
  </slot>
  <slot name="choices">
    <div part="choices">
      <oui-radio />
      <oui-radio />
      <oui-radio />
      ...
    </div>
  </slot>
</oui-radio-group>
```

#### DOM Structure (Explicit Grouping)

The following structure, in contrast, represents a group with an empty `choices` slot. The choices are placed outside the group, providing layout flexibility. Each choice has a `group` attribute with value equal to the radio group's name, making them explicitly bound as choices of that group.

There is also the possibility of having both implicit and explicit choices.

```html
<oui-radio-group name="group-name">
  <slot name="label">
    <label part="label"></label>
  </slot>
  <slot name="required-indicator">
    <div part="required-indicator"></div>
  </slot>
  <slot name="choices">
    <div part="choices">
      ... (it could also be populated)
    </div>
  </slot>
</oui-radio-group>

<oui-radio group="group-name" />
<oui-radio group="group-name" />
<oui-radio group="group-name" />
```
