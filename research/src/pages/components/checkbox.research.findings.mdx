## What is a checkbox?

A checkbox is a control that allows the user to select a binary “checked” state, either checked or unchecked. They may also support a second binary “indeterminate” state.

### Checkbox vs toggle

Checkboxes should usually be grouped together in a set, and the user can select zero, one, or any number of items within that list. If only one checkbox is used, it is the same thing as using a toggle or switch component. Both checkboxes and switches can support an indeterminate state.

Checkboxes should not be used when only one item in the list can be selected.

## General appearances

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
  <div style="flex: 1">
    <p>
      Usually a label follows the checkbox, which should clearly describe the state when the box is
      checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally a checkbox is square, but it may have rounded corners. When checked, the square box
      can fill with any color with a check appearing in a contrasting foreground color.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 20%">
    <img src="/images/checkbox-1.png" alt="checkbox example" />
  </div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
  <div style="flex: 1">
    <p>
      Alternatively, when checked, the box background can remain the same and a foreground check
      element may appear.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 20%">
    <img src="/images/checkbox-2.png" alt="checkbox outline example" />
  </div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
  <div style="flex: 1">
    <p>The style of the label can also change when the checkbox is checked.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 20%">

  </div>
</div>

### Indeterminate checkboxes

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
  <div style="flex: 1">
    <p>
      When a checkbox’s value is neither true nor false, it is indeterminate. An indeterminate
      checkbox may be gray, or shown with a different mark inside the checkbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeterminate checkboxes are often used in a hierarchy of checkboxes, when not all children
      are checked, the parent remains indeterminate.
    </p>
    <div class="question">
      <em>Should there be a new element for checkbox hierarchy and indeterminate checkboxes?</em>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 20%">
    <img src="/images/checkbox-4.png" alt="indeterminate checkbox example" />
  </div>
</div>

### Checkbox state

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
  <div style="flex: 1">
    <p>
      A checkbox visually changes depending on the element state: focused, disabled, hover, or
      active. This can mean adding a shadow, border, or changing color of the box and check. The
      label can also change style during each state.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 50%">
    <img
      src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uIZAD8BqdUty_SKq4IqRBcQ5LZEDl_4obrO2eWArEW2FNrP6o1PgRAJrmaGM1nfF9pCI7dQKvftHIJHFBSFpAS_1HbT_3RPSv8DrJjI=w1064-v0"
      alt="Matrix of all checkbox state combinations"
    />
  </div>
</div>

### Switch (toggle)

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
  <div style="flex: 1">
    <p>
      A switch is usually larger and has more visual weight than a checkbox. The toggle often also
      has a primary label describing the state, and a secondary label describing the selected state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a checkbox, a switch can also have unique styles per element state: focused, disabled,
      hover, or active.
    </p>
    <div class="question">
      <em>Should switch be a separate component?</em>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 20%">
    <img src="/images/toggle-1.png" alt="google material switch example" />
    <img src="/images/toggle-2.png" alt="other switch example" />
  </div>
</div>

### Animation

A checkbox or switch may have animations on transitions between each element state:

<img src="/images/lock-checkbox.gif" alt="checkbox animation example" />
<img src="/images/flip-checkbox.gif" alt="checkbox animation example" />

_Note: There should be no animation if disabled in the browser or system preferences._

## Common behaviors

### Selecting

Clicking the label or the checkbox should toggle the component. Being able to select the label is important, because the checkbox itself can be quite small and difficult to select on high resolution screens. Clicking the label or checkbox a subsequent time, should uncheck the checkbox.

### Disabled

A disabled checkbox should not change state when clicked.

## Accessibility (keyboard, AT support, etc)

- I should be able to navigate and select by keyboard.
- Clicking or tapping the label of the checkbox should toggle the component state.
- As a user, I expect that there will be no animation in case I disabled animations from system preferences.
- As a user, I should see a clear focus style.
- As a user, In multiple checkboxes, I should hear the question or title related to them.

## A survey of checkboxes in the wild

It is very common for developers to build custom checkbox implementations that closely match a company's brand.
In order to understand how checkboxes are used across the web, we surveyed the public web sites of [Interbrand's top 100](https://www.interbrand.com/best-global-brands/) brands.
This list is useful because it includes brands with websites that are Alexa ranked from the top 10 to the top 500,000.
We analyzed these custom checkbox implementations for the following issues:

1. Does the checkbox have a visible focus state? When building a custom checkbox, it is easy to to implement it in a way that removes any focus indicator.
2. Is the user able to select the checkbox by also clicking on the label? Accessibility is reduced when only the checkbox, not the label, is interactable.
3. Does the checkbox have an aria compatible computed name? Without a computed name, a screen reader will not know how to identify the checkbox.

### Results

|                        | All    | Top 100 | Top 100-500 | Top 500-5k | Top 5k-50k | Top 50k - Million |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Invisible Focus State  | 16.13% | 20.00%  | 10.00%      | 13.79%     | 23.08%     | 6.67%             |
| Non-interactable Label | 30.11% | 13.33%  | 20.00%      | 31.03%     | 34.62%     | 40.00%            |
| No Computed Name       | 59.14% | 13.33%  | 10.00%      | 20.69%     | 19.23%     | 20.00%            |
| Has any issue          | 44.09% | 26.67%  | 40.00%      | 48.28%     | 50.00%     | 46.67%            |

The main takeaway from these numbers is that the industry massively fails to build custom checkboxes correctly.
These are the biggest brands in the world. The survey was not exhaustive either. For each brand, we spent 5-10 minutes
finding and accessing checkbox implementations. Undoubtedly an exhaustive search would discover many more issues.
