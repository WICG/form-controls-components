# {ComponentName} Component Specification

## Overview

*The name of the component, along with a high-level description.*

### Background

*Relevant historical or background information, related existing issues, etc.*

### Use Cases

*Primary use cases for this component.*

### Non-goals

*A list of use cases, features, or functionality which are **not** goals for the component.*
  
### Features

*A list of the key features unique to this component.*

### Risks and Challenges

*Notable risks or challenges associated with the component. Link issues related to platform blockers.*

### Prior Art/Examples

*Link to the OpenUI research page for the component. If any existing, canonical, or exemplary implementations of the component are found beyond what is documented in the research page, make a separate PR to add them there.*

---

## Design

*Describe the design of the component, thinking through several perspectives:*

- *A customer using the component on a web page.*
- *A developer building an app with the component and interacting through HTML/CSS/JavaScript.*
- *A designer customizing the component.*

### API

*Outline the key elements of the component's public API surface, taking into consideration conformance guidelines. Make sure to discuss differences and rationalizations. Consider high and low-level APIs. Attempt to design a powerful and extensible low-level API with a high-level API for developer/designer ergonomics and simplicity.*

#### Properties and Attributes

*Example Table*

| Property Name | Attribute Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `value` | `value` | `number` | Value of `min` | The current value of the slider. |
| `min` | `min` | `number` | `0` | The minimum value of the slider. |

#### Methods

*Example Table*

| Signature | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| `increment(value: number = this.step): void` | Increments the `value` of the component by the amount specified by `step`, clamped within `min`/`max` values. |
| `decrement(value: number = this.step): void` | Decrements the `value` of the component by the amount specified by `step`, clamped within `min`/`max` values. |

#### Events

*Example Table*

| Event Name | Detail Type | Bubbles | Composed | Cancellable | Dispatch Behavior |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| `change` | none | `true` | `true` | `false` | Fired when the slider's `value` changes. |

### Appearance

*Screenshots and/or description of the basic appearance of the component.*

### Anatomy

*Outline the component's structure with a diagram of its render tree. Enumerate key areas of visual composition and customization.*

#### Diagram

*Example*

![Example Diagram](../images/spec-diagram-example.png)

#### DOM Structure

*Define the recommended DOM to represent the component's anatomy, as shown above. Show how important attributes (aria attributes especially) are applied to the various parts. In cases where a component nests other components, expand the full DOM structure to understand the expectation and any shortcomings in the child components' customizability.*

#### Slots

*What parts of the component are composable or replaceable?*

*Example Table*

| Slot Name | Description | Fallback Content |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `thumb` | Enables replacing the component's `thumb` part with custom markup. | A default thumb implementation is provided. |

#### Host Classes

*What classes does the component add to the host element?*

| Class Name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |

#### Slotted Content Classes

*What classes on slotted content does the component respond to?*

| Class Name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |

#### CSS Parts

*What parts of the component are exposed for styling?*

*Example Table*

| Part Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `thumb` | Enables styling the `thumb` part without requiring it to be completely replaced via its slot. |

---

## Behavior

### States and Interactions

*List key component states, valid state transitions, and how interactions trigger state transitions.*

- *Are states changed as a result of keyboard? mouse? touch?*
- *Are there corresponding keyboard interactions for mouse/touch interactions?*
- *Are some events triggered on key down vs key press?*

*Example Table*

| State Group | States | Initial State | Description | Interaction/Transition |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `disabled` | `true`/`false` | `false` | When `true`, disables the control, preventing user interaction and displaying the control with a disabled appearance. | No interaction. Controlled programmatically. |

### Accessibility

*Consider the accessibility of the component.*

#### Keyboard Navigation and Focus

- *Arrow vs tabbing key behavior*
- *Modifier key effects (e.g. shift, ctrl, meta)*
- *Does this component use focus delegation?*

*Example Table*

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Up/Right  | Increments the value of the component by calling the `increment` method. If the `shift` modifier is pressed, increases by 10x the `step` value. |
| Down/Left | Decrements the value of the component by calling the `decrement` method. If the `shift` modifier is pressed, decreases by 10x the `step` value. |

#### Form Input

*Does this component integrate with form submission, form validation, etc.? Can integration be accomplish with standard APIs or are special work-arounds required?*

#### Use with Assistive Technology

*Are there any details about shadow dom, focus delegation, or aria attributes that need special attention?*

### Globalization

*Consider whether the component has any special globalization needs such as:*

- *Special RTL handling*
- *Swapping of internal icons/visuals*
- *Localization*

### Security

*Are there any security implications surrounding the component?*

### Performance

*Are there any performance pitfalls or challenges with implementing the component? (examples below)*

* If the component renders a loop of items, should certain areas be considered for virtualization?
* If the component needs to measure an area before rendering, how will jank be avoided?
* If any measuring is needed at all, can rAF techniques help queue measures and prevent synchronous reflows?

## Dependencies

*Will implementing the component require taking on any dependencies?*

- *3rd party libraries*
- *Upcoming standards we need to polyfill*
- *Do any dependencies bring along an associated timeline?*

### Platform Requirements

*Are there any core web platform features that are needed to implement this component well?*

### Tooling

*Are there any special considerations for DevTools? Will tooling changes need to be made? Is there a special way to light up this component in DevTools that would be compelling for developers/designers?*

---

## Resources

*Any related resource links such as web standards, discussion threads, diagrams, etc.*

---

## Next Steps

*What next steps, if any, are there? Is there some functionality that would be a nice-to-have or a common feature in other implementations that could be added but is not considered part of the MVP? Link all feature additions, modifications, bugs, or editorial change issues.*
