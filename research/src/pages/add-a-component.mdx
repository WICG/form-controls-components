# Add a Component

Adding a component to Open UI is a research process.
Because of this, two pages are created for each component; a research page and a curated page.
Create your component pages like so:

```
/src
  /components
    your-component.mdx           # curated page
    your-component.research.mdx  # research page
```

## Curated Page

The curated page will summarize your findings, conclusions, and unresolved points.
It will be published publicly.

## Research Page

The research page is a place to collect, analyse, and deeply understand the data available on the component.
It will not be published publicly but it will remain as source material justifying your curated page.

If you followed the steps in [Add a design system](/contribute/design-system) then there are some MDX components available in Open UI's docs to help analyze and understand the data collected.
You can reference some other component doc pages for usage examples.
Otherwise, you can collect and analyze your data more manually.
