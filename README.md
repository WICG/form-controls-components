# Open A11Y
> **Tip:** This repo is in development. Ideas and patterns you'll see here are in-progress. You are encouraged to join in and help shape the foundation of Open A11Y.

**:rocket: Mission:** Research accessibility across component libraries.

**:busts_in_silhouette: Audience:** The broader UI community including designers, engineers, and managers. Learn more at https://jurokapsiar.github.io/open-a11y.

## Why?

Different screen readers and browsers to large extent provide different experience for the users. [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/) did a great job at standardizing approach to complex patterns, but component libraries not yet follow it completly or decide to deviate from it, in order to optimize experience for particular screnarios.

Open A11Y is a open source collective effort to map and test these approaches.
